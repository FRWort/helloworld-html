	<h1>About</h1>
	<pre>The following are standard commands between climber and belayer, from the beginning to the end of a pitch. This example involves a female belayer and a male climber.

<b>Climber: That's me!</b> The belayer above is taking in all the slack rope before putting it into her belay device. The climber calls this when he is tugged by the rope from above, indicating that there is no more rope to take in.

<b>Belayer: Belay on!</b> The belayer is anchored in and has the rope set up through her belay device. She calls this command to let the climber know she's ready to belay.

<b>Climber: Slack!</b> The climber needs extra rope in order to make the first move or to finish taking apart his belay anchor.

<b>Climber: Up rope!</b> The climber no longer needs the slack in the rope. Asks belayer to take it in. (This can be used at any point in the climb to signal to the belayer to take up slack.)
